We show that the class of Bernstein functions is equivalent to the class
of all functions that send Manhattan distances to Manhattan distances.
This work is a natural generalization of Schoenberg's work on metric
transforms of Euclidean distances from 1938~\cite{s38,
  s42, ns41}.
Our proof techniques differ from those in Schoenberg's
original work, although they bear similarity to existing proofs of
Lemma~\ref{lem:l1-old}~\cite{dl09}.

We hope that this work inspires future work on Schoenberg-like theorems
about functions $f$ that sends $\ell_p$ to $\ell_q$ for arbitrary $p$
and $q$.
In general, we are very
interested in classifying functions that send metric space ${\cal X}$ to
metric space ${\cal Y}$ for various ${\cal X}$ and ${\cal Y}$. We
believe such work should have rich applications.
