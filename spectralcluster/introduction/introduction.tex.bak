\section{Introduction}

The Cheeger and Buser inequalities relate isoperimetric cuts with eigenvalues.
Up to a constant factor, the Cheeger inequality lower bounds the
fundamental eigenvalue of a Laplacian with the square of
the isoperimetric constant~\cite{Cheeger70, AlonM84}, and the Buser inequality upper
bounds the eigenvalue with the isoperimetric constant~\cite{Buser82, AlonM84}.

These inequalities appear in two settings: the graph
setting~\cite{AlonM84} and the manifold setting~\cite{Cheeger70,
Buser82}.  In graphs, these inequalities are the foundation of spectral
graph theory~\cite{ChungBook97, AlonM84}. Spectral graph theory
has provided surprising insights on problems including maximum
flow~\cite{CKMST}, fast Laplacian solving~\cite{KMP}, expander
decompositions~\cite{wulff17expander, sw19expander}, sparse
cuts~\cite{AlonM84, arv04, chawla05sparse}, and longstanding
mathematical conjectures like the Kaddison Singer conjecture~\cite{MSS}.
In this setting, the Buser inequality is trivial, and the Cheeger
inequality is mathematically substantial~\cite{AlonM84,ChungBook97}.  In
manifold theory, the Cheeger and Buser inequalities have proven useful
for probability theory on manifolds~\cite{ledoux2004spectral}, machine
learning~\cite{belkin2004semisup}, and more~\cite{belkin2005towards, ledoux2004spectral}.
Unlike in the graph setting, the Buser inequality on manifolds is highly
nontrivial, and historically came as a surprise to manifold
theorists~\cite{Buser82, ledoux2004spectral}.

Our paper introduces Cheeger and Buser inequalities in a new setting:
Lipschitz probability density functions. 
Here, a
probability density function refers to a function $\rho: \RR^d
\rightarrow \RR_{\geq 0}$ where $\int_{\RR^d} \rho = 1$. A Lipschitz
probability density refers to a probability density $\rho$ where
$|\rho(x)-\rho(y)| < L\|x-y\|_2$ for some constant $L$.
Cheeger inequalities
have been used in the probability density setting in the
past~\cite{Lee18survey}, but primarily in the setting where there are
strong parametric assumptions on the density (such as when the density
is Gaussian or log-concave)~\cite{Lee18survey}. 
We show that for general Lipschitz probability densities,  
either the Cheeger or the Buser inequality must fail using past
definitions of eigenvalue and isoperimetric constant.  

Since past definitions of eigenvalue and isoperimetric constant are
inadequate in the probability density setting, we present new
definitions of these quantities for which a Cheeger and Buser inequality
will hold. Using our new definitions, the Cheeger inequality can be
proven using standard techniques. Akin to the manifold setting, the
Buser inequality here is more difficult to prove. New mathematical ideas
are required to prove the Buser inequality. We prove both the
Cheeger and Buser inequalities on Lipschitz probability densities, using
our new definitions.

\subsubsection{Applications}
We will use our inequalities to show that a spectral sweep cut of a
Lipschitz
probability density functions will partition it into two pieces with
good sparsity guarantees.  We then discuss potential applications to
machine learning and spectral clustering. 

Spectral clustering~\cite{ShiMalik97,
NgSpectral01} is one of the most widely used techniques in machine
learning~\cite{von2007tutorial}. It is known to have a close connection to
past definitions for eigenvalues of a probability density
function~\cite{TrillosVariational15}. However, spectral clustering is
not known to have any good theoretical sparsity guarantees on partition quality as the number
of samples grows large,
in part due to the lack of a Cheeger and Buser inequality for past
definitions of eigenvalues.  Our new Cheeger and Buser inequalities may
motivate theoretically principled spectral clustering methods.
