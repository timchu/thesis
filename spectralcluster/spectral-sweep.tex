\section{Spectral Sweep Cuts have Provably Good Sparsity (proof of
    Theorem~\ref{thm:sweep-cut})}\label{sec:sweep_cut}

Theorem~\ref{thm:cheeger-sweep} tells us that 
  \[ \Phi_{(1,2, 3)}^2/4 \leq \lambda_2^{(1,3)} \] for all $1$-Lipschitz $\rho$ whose
  domain is
  on $\mathbb{R}^d$.  Here, $\phi_{(1,2,3)}$ is the $(1,2)$ sparsity of the
  $(1,3)$-spectral sweep cut, and $\lambda_2^{(1,3)}$ is the
  $(1,3)$-principal eigenvalue. 

  Next Theorem~\ref{thm:buser_n} tells us that
 \[ \lambda_2^{(1,3)} \leq O(d \Phi_{(1,2)}), \]
 where $\Phi_{(1,2)}$ is the minimal $(1,2)$-sparsity of any cut through
 $\rho$.

 Therefore, 
 \[ \Phi_{(1,2,3)}^2 \leq  \Phi_{(1,2)} \leq \Phi_{(1,2,3)}^2,\] 
 where $\Phi_{(1,2)}$ is the minimum $(1,2)$-sparsity of a cut through
 $\rho$, proving Theorem~\ref{thm:sweep-cut}.
