abstract = "Spectral partitioning methods use the Fiedler vectorâthe eigenvector of the second-smallest eigenvalue of the Laplacian matrixâto find a small separator of a graph. These methods are important components of many scientific numerical algorithms and have been demonstrated by experiment to work extremely well. In this paper, we show that spectral partitioning methods work well on bounded-degree planar graphs and finite element meshesâthe classes of graphs to which they are usually applied. While naive spectral bisection does not necessarily work, we prove that spectral partitioning techniques can be used to produce separators whose ratio of vertices removed to edges cut is O(n) for bounded-degree planar graphs and two-dimensional meshes and O(n1/d) for well-shaped d-dimensional meshes. The heart of our analysis is an upper bound on the second-smallest eigenvalues of the Laplacian matrices of these graphs: we prove a bound of O(1/n) for bounded-degree planar graphs and O(1/n2/d) for well-shaped d-dimensional meshes."

abstract={We consider point clouds obtained as random samples of a measure on a Euclidean domain. A graph representing the point cloud is obtained by assigning weights to edges based on the distance between the points they connect. Our goal is to develop mathematical tools needed to study the consistency, as the number of available data points increases, of graph-based machine learning algorithms for tasks such as clustering. In particular, we study when the cut capacity, and more generally total variation, on these graphs is a good approximation of the perimeter (total variation) in the continuum setting. We address this question in the setting of $\Gamma$-convergence. We obtain almost optimal conditions on the scaling, as the number of points increases, of the size of the neighborhood over which the points are connected by an edge for the $\Gamma$-convergence to hold. Taking of the limit is enabled by a transportation based metric which allows us to suitably compare functionals defined on different point clouds.},

	Abstract = {Let P be a Poisson process of intensity one in a square $S_n$ of area n. We construct a random geometric graph $G_n,k$ by joining each point of P to its k $\equiv$ k(n) nearest neighbours. Recently, Xue and Kumar proved that if k $\leq$ 0.074 log n then the probability that $G_n,k$ is connected tends to 0 as n $\rightarrow \infty$ while, if k $\geq$ 5.1774 log n, then the probability that $G_n,k$ is connected tends to 1 as n $\rightarrow \infty$. They conjectured that the threshold for connectivity is k = (1 + o(1)) log n. In this paper we improve these lower and upper bounds to 0.3043 log n and 0.5139 log n, respectively, disproving this conjecture. We also establish lower and upper bounds of 0.7209 log n and 0.9967 log n for the directed version of this problem. A related question concerns coverage. With $G_n,k$ as above, we surround each vertex by the smallest (closed) disc containing its k nearest neighbours. We prove that if k $\leq$ 0.7209 log n then the probability that these discs cover $S_n$ tends to 0 as n $\rightarrow \infty$ while, if k $\geq$ 0.9967 log n, then the probability that the discs cover $S_n$ tends to 1 as n $\rightarrow \infty$.},

	Abstract = {The Fast Marching Method is a numerical algorithm for solving the Eikonal equation on a rectangular orthogonal mesh in O(M log M) steps, where M is the total number of grid points. In this paper we extend the Fast Marching Method to triangulated domains with the same computational complexity. As an application, we provide an optimal time algorithm for computing the geodesic distances and thereby extracting shortest paths on triangulated manifolds.},

	Abstract = {The K-Means clustering is by far the most widely used method for discovering clusters in data. It has a good performance on the data with compact super-sphere distributions, but tends to fail in the data organized in more complex and unknown shapes. In this paper, we analyze in detail the characteristic property of data clustering and propose a novel dissimilarity measure, named density-sensitive distance metric, which can describe the distribution characteristic of data clustering. By using this dissimilarity measure, a density-sensitive K-Means clustering algorithm is given, which has the ability to identify complex non-convex clusters compared with the original K-Means algorithm. The experimental results on both artificial data sets and real-world problems assess the validity of the algorithm.},
