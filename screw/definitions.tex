\subsection{Definitions and Preliminaries} % (fold)
\label{sec:definitions}
In this section, we establish additional definitions for this chapter. These
are mostly of interest for our spanner and persistent homology results, and are not strictly
necessary for Theorem~\ref{thm:NN}.

\noindent \textbf{Spanners:} For real value $t \geq 1$, a $t$-spanner of
a weighted graph $G$ is a subgraph $S$ such that $d_G(x,y) \leq d_S(x,y)
\leq t\cdot d_G(x,y)$ where $d_G$ and $d_S$ represent the shortest path
distance functions between vertex pairs in $G$ and $S$. Spanners
of Euclidean distances, and general graph distances, have been
studied extensively, and their importance as a data structure is
well established.

\noindent \textbf{$k$-nearest neighbor graphs:} The $k$-nearest neighbor graph
($k$-NN graph) for a set of objects $V$ is a graph with vertex set $V$
and an edge from $v\in V$ to its $k$ most similar objects in $V$, under
a given distance measure. In this chapter, the underlying distance
measure is Euclidean, and the edge weights are Euclidean distance
squared.
$k$-NN
graph constructions are a key data structure in machine
learning~\cite{Dong11, Chen11}, clustering~\cite{vL09}, and manifold learning~\cite{tenenbaum00global}.

\noindent \textbf{Gabriel Graphs:} The Gabriel graph is a graph where
two vertices $p$ and $q$ are joined by an edge if and only if the disk
with diameter $pq$ has no other points of $S$ in the interior. The
Gabriel graph is a subgraph of the Delaunay
triangulation~\cite{SridharMaster}, and a
$1$-spanner of the edge-squared metric~\cite{SridharMaster}. Gabriel
graphs will be used in the proof of
Theorem~\ref{thm:distribution-spanner}.

\noindent \textbf{Persistent Homology:}
  Persistent homology is a popular tool in computational geometry and topology to ascribe quantitative topological invariants to spaces that are stable with respect to perturbation of the input.
  In particular, it's possible to compare the so-called persistence diagram of a function defined on a sample to that of the complete space~\cite{chazal08towards}.
  These two aspects of persistence theory---the intrinsic nature of topological invariants and the ability to rigorously compare the discrete and the continuous---are both also present in our theory of nearest neighbor metrics.
  Indeed, our primary motivation for studying these metrics was to use them as inputs to persistence computations for problems such as persistence-based clustering~\cite{chazal13persistence} or metric graph reconstruction~\cite{aanjaneya12metric}.
