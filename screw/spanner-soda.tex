\section{Spanners for the nearest neighbor metric}
In this section, we prove our theorems on spanners of the nearest neighbor
metric. The proofs of these theorems mostly leverage Theorem~\ref{thm:NN}
and past work on geometric spanners. We have nonetheless included them
for completeness, and to illustrate that spanners of
manifold distances like the nearest neighbor metric can have interesting
properties not found in Euclidean spanners (assuming no Steiner points).
